A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with *DD-Payne*, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.6 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The $[{\rm Fe/H}]$ is valid down to $\simeq -4.0$, while elemental abundance ratios $[X/{\rm Fe}]$ are mostly valid for stars with $[{\rm Fe/H}] \gtrsim -2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with $SNR > 50$, we achieved a typical error of $30\,{\rm K}$ in $T_{\rm eff}$, $0.07\,{\rm dex}$ in $\log g$, $\sim 0.05\,{\rm dex}$ in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and $0.1{-}0.2\,{\rm dex}$ for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the $[{\rm Fe/H}]$ estimates, the $T_{\rm eff}$ is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available. test
